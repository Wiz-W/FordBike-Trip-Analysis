## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area,which cut across 183412 ROWS and 16 COLUMNS with several variables like Gender,location start date/start time with variuos user_type within the month of February-March of 2019.
_N.B: **0.6%(i.e 8460 data) missing data was dropped during the data cleaning**
     **New features were added after date cleaning such as age,start_date and End_date which led to a new dataset called cleaned-bike-dataset.csv.**
     
## Summary of Findings

From the Exploratory Data Analysis above several findings and observation has been carried within one,two or more variables in the bike trip datasets to prove different outcome of interests. **Firstly**,knowing the most start_date for majority of bike shared in San Francisco and the most frequent Start_station located in San Francisco not only that, findings were also carried out using an histogram to know the distribution of Age and Duration(sec) and included the proportion rate using pie-chart for user_type and different Gender that bike was distributed to in San Francisco which happen to be more Male in which majority of those male where for the Subscriber user_type and several relationship were also carried out using scatter plot in the **bivariate** and **multivariate** to show relationship between various features such as member_age and duration_sec using User_type and member_gender as a point of preference.

## Key Insights for Presentation

My Presentation was majorly based on **Four(4) attributes from Bike sharing system two(2) categorical features(User_type and member_gender) and two(2) numerical features(Age and Trip_duration)**.I also started by using Histogram to know the Age distribution of Bikers in Log-scale and Bike Trip duration in sec(using histogram) and also figuring out the proportion(%) of how bike was distributed to several gender in San Francisco and how bike was shared to different bikers(user_type) also knowing the correlation between two(2) numerical features associated with different Gender and User_type(Bikers) using Scatter plot.
